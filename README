Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::YubiKey

Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS

    Authenticate Catalyst apps with Yubico's YubiKey system.

    Uses the Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication system.

     use Catalyst qw(
       ...
       Authentication
       ...
     );

     __PACKAGE__->config(
       'Plugin::Authentication' => {
         default => {
           credential => {
             class => 'YubiKey',

             # This is your API ID, from http://api.yubico.com/get-api-key/
             api_id => 666,

             # This is your API Key, as above:
             api_key => 'aaaaaaad34db33fzzzzzzzzzz/abc=',

             # This is the column in your store that contains the yubikey ID,
             # for mapping that ID to username or whatever.
             id_for_store => 'id',
           },
           ...
         },
       },
     );

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

TODO

    I am currently using Auth::Yubikey_WebClient as the underlying library
    for querying Yubico's webservice. However it would be nice if that
    library was improved to return more of the details, rather than just
    'OK'.

    Also would be good to support in-house authentication servers. (Since
    Yubico have open-sourced theirs, and some people may be using such.)
