=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::YubiKey - YubiKey authentication

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Authenticate Catalyst apps with Yubico's YubiKey system.

Uses the Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication system.

  use Catalyst qw(
    ...
    Authentication
    ...
  );

  __PACKAGE__->config(
    'Plugin::Authentication' => {
      default => {
        credential => {
          class => 'YubiKey',

          # This is your API ID, from http://yubico.com/developers/api/
          api_id => 666,

          # This is your API Key, as above:
          api_key => 'aaaaaaad34db33fzzzzzzzzzz/abc=',

          # This is the column in your store that contains the yubikey ID,
          # for mapping that ID to username or whatever.
          # It defaults to 'id' if not specified.
          id_for_store => 'id',
        },
        ...
      },
    },
  );

=head1 TODO

I am currently using Auth::Yubikey_WebClient as the underlying library for
querying Yubico's webservice. However it would be nice if that library was
improved to return more of the details, rather than just 'OK'.

Also would be good to support in-house authentication servers. (Since Yubico
have open-sourced theirs, and some people may be using such.)

Extracts the config

        );
    }
    return $config;
}

=head2 authenticate

Standard authentication method, as per Cat-Auth-Credential standard.

=cut

sub authenticate {
    my ($self, $c, $realm, $authinfo) = @_;
    my $otp = $authinfo->{otp};

    my $result = Auth::Yubikey_WebClient::yubikey_webclient(
        $otp, $self->api_id, $self->api_key
    );
    unless ($result eq 'OK') {
        $c->log->error("User auth failed: $result");
        return;
    }

    # The user ID seems to be the first 12 characters..
    my $yubi_id = substr($otp, 0, 12);
    my $user = $realm->find_user({ $self->id_for_store => $yubi_id });
    unless ($user) {
        $c->log->error("Authenticated user, but could not locate in "
            ." our Store!");
        return;
    }
    return $user;
}
